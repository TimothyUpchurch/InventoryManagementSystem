# InventoryManagementSystem
Developed in C# and WinForms to learn the basics of data binding. A more comprehensive C# application is listed on this github under the AppointmentSchedulingApp repository.

# What This Application Does
* Tracks the inventory of parts and products for a company.
* Allows the user to Add, Update, and delete parts and products.
* Validates user input in real time to highlight any user error. Ex: MachineId in the add/modify part form expects an Integer. If any thing other than an Integer is entered the field will indicate an error.
